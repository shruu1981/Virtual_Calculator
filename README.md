Hand Gesture Controlled Calculator
This project is a hand gesture-controlled calculator using OpenCV, cvzone, and a webcam. The calculator's interface is built with OpenCV, and hand gestures are detected using the cvzone library, allowing users to interact with the calculator buttons via hand gestures.

Features
Hand Gesture Detection: The calculator detects hand gestures to simulate button presses.
Simple Calculator Functions: Supports basic arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Real-Time Interaction: Interact with the calculator in real-time using your webcam.
Error Handling: The calculator provides basic error handling for invalid expressions.

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/shruu1981/Virtual_Calculator.git

Demo

How it Works
The project uses cvzone and OpenCV for real-time hand detection and tracking.
The calculator interface is drawn using OpenCV functions.
When a user makes a gesture close to a button, it simulates a button press, and the calculator performs the corresponding operation.
