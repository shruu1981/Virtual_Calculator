Hand Gesture Controlled Calculator
This project is a hand gesture-controlled calculator using OpenCV, cvzone, and a webcam. The calculator's interface is built with OpenCV, and hand gestures are detected using the cvzone library, allowing users to interact with the calculator buttons via hand gestures.

Features
Hand Gesture Detection: The calculator detects hand gestures to simulate button presses.
Simple Calculator Functions: Supports basic arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Real-Time Interaction: Interact with the calculator in real-time using your webcam.
Error Handling: The calculator provides basic error handling for invalid expressions.
Requirements
Python 3.x
OpenCV
cvzone
Mediapipe (cvzone dependency)
Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hand-gesture-calculator.git

bash
Copy code
cd hand-gesture-calculator
Install the required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
How to Run
Ensure that your webcam is connected and properly set up.

Run the main script:

bash
Copy code
python hand_calculator.py
The webcam window will open, showing the calculator interface. You can interact with the buttons using your hand gestures.

Demo

How it Works
The project uses cvzone and OpenCV for real-time hand detection and tracking.
The calculator interface is drawn using OpenCV functions.
When a user makes a gesture close to a button, it simulates a button press, and the calculator performs the corresponding operation.
